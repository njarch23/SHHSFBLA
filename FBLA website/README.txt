FBLA Dev Catalyst Website
-------------------------
My group consisted of Dakota Hickson and me, Noah Archer.  I coded the website mostly by myself as my partner is not as good
at coding as I am, but he assisted with me with the design aspect and helped fueld my thought process.  I am a strong functional programmer but lack a little of the design aspect.  Regardless, my website has turned out as a success, and I am immensely proud of my own creation.  My client, The Future Business Leaders of America club at my school, approved of the color scheme and the "block" layout, and the design was what they had wanted to be implemented in their website.  The design philosophy was to have "blocks" of information to stand out against the white background of the website.  My client was very happy with this design and it helps to group information that is related together. 

Other improtant info about my website
----------------------------------------
It is important to note that while my form does not technically work or do anything with the information given, it could be easily implemented on a server with PHP.  Also,  I used javascript to help with my slideshow on both the homepage and the competition page.  My calendar could also be improved with the help of more javascript experience that I would possibly learn in a more advanced class.  As the calendar sits now, it must be updated manually by a user everyday to keep track of the current day.  Advanced CSS transitions were also used to help create the rotating cube that can be seen on my gallery page (Note: the cubes will rotate upon the :hover psuedo class being triggered by the user's cursor).


Problems with Internet Explorer
---------------------------------
I have documented several issues with internet explorer over the course of building my website that happens for only internet explorer.  While experimenting with Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome, I have been able to make my website fully functional for all of the browsers except for internet explorer.  I have been able to resolve the majority of the issues I have encountered with Internet Explorer however some are unavoidable.  With regards to my rotating cubes as seen on the gallery page, they have no functionality what so ever in Internet Explorer, but work perfectly fine in every other major browser.  Also, random links will stop working for no apparent reason in Internet Explorer such as the ones in the nav, but these links will work perfectly fine in any other major browser.  After further research, this could be a variety of issues with IE ranging from security, privacy, or even the way Internet Explorer cache's my website.
