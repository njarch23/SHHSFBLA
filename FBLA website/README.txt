FBLA Dev Catalyst Website
-------------------------
My group consisted of Dakota Hickson and I, Noah Archer.  I worked on the website mostly by myself as my partner is not as good
at coding as I am, but he assisted with me with the design aspect.  I am a strong functional programmer but lack the design 
aspect.  Regardless, my website has turned out as a success, and I am immensely proud of my own creation.  My client, 
The Future Business Leaders of America club at my school, approved of the color scheme and the "block" layout, and the design
was what they had wanted to be implemented in their website.  It is important to note that while my form does not technically 
work or do anything with the information given, it could be easily implemented on a server with PHP.  Also,  I used javascript 
to help with my slideshow on both the homepage and the competition page.  Advanced CSS transitions were also used to 
help create the rotating cube that can be seen on my gallery page (Note: the cubes will rotate upon the :hover psuedo class
being triggered by the user's cursor).
